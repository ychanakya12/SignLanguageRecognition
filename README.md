# SignLanguageRecognition
The Sign Language Recognition project uses a Kaggle dataset (e.g., Sign Language MNIST) to classify hand signs into letters using deep learning. Built in Jupyter with TensorFlow, it employs CNNs to process grayscale images. Preprocessing includes normalization, and EDA explores sign patterns. Achieving ~90% accuracy, it aids communication for the deaf community.
